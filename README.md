Progress:
Completed 3 labs using PortSwigger and ZAP:
SQL Injection (e.g., bypassing WHERE clause constraints).
Authentication (e.g., username enumeration).
Access Control (e.g., accessing admin functionalities).
Reflection:
I used PortSwigger and ZAP to capture and modify HTTP requests. In exploring SQL injection vulnerabilities, I learned the importance of precision in crafting queries. ZAP proved particularly helpful in automating security testing processes. The main challenges were managing syntax and integrating tools, but the instructions were clear. I successfully completed all tasks, gaining insights into identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities in web applications. This experience enhanced my skills and motivated me to continue testing.

Development of the Registration Page: Created and tested a registration page using Docker and Deno environments. The goal was to ensure a fully functional and tested registration page as part of the booking system.

Analysis of SQL Injection Vulnerabilities: Used PortSwigger and ZAP to explore how SQL injections can bypass query constraints and reveal data. For example, +OR+1=1-- was used to simulate an attack.

Authentication and Access Control: Investigated vulnerabilities in login systems, such as username enumeration through error messages, and analyzed access control issues.

Automated Security Testing: Performed automated scans on the server (localhost:8000) using ZAP. This identified security issues, such as missing HTTP headers ).

GitHub Documentation: Updated all findings and test results in the logbook and the GitHub repository. I got help from classmate.





1.Dec.2024 Submission:

Summary:

This phase of the project was completed according to the instructions, and all progress has been documented in the GitHub logbook.

The work on Phase 1 of the Booking System Project provided a strong foundation for this assignment, especially in setting up the development environment and understanding core functionalities.

The registration page (localhost:8000/register) was successfully implemented and tested. However, I encountered issues with the login functionality and was unable to log in as expected. Despite this, I followed all other steps, including functionality and vulnerability tests for the login page and the entire system (index, login, register). Reports were generated using Checkmarx ZAP, converted to MD format, and added to the repository.

Next, I will focus on debugging the login feature and improving it in the upcoming test cycle. The assignment has been submitted with the required updates and documentation.


I apdate my logbook better SOON.
